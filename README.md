# File/Folder Structure
While many Garry's Mod addons favor an in-depth folder hierarchy, Photon 2 keeps client/shared/server core logic files within the `photon-v2` folder and "classes" in the `photon-v2/meta` folder. This is primarily done to make file switching easier (Ctrl+P in VSCode), as more generic filenames tend to match others.
